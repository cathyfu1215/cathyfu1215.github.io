**Hello World!**

This is my first post. I am still learning on how to use Jekyll.
Today I will be working on adding posts and projects to my github page.

I am using Vim as a editor. As a non-native speaker of English, I wonder if we can have spell-checking in Vim. So I googled it, and then I found this ```:set spell ```.Let's try it.

A typo: i an a type.

OK, it works. It alert me about "github" and "I an a typo". However, it cannot detect another typo : I misspelled "typo" to "type".  

You can see the screenshot:

Aha! It worked. Now I know how to attach an image.

Special thanks to those tutorials:
